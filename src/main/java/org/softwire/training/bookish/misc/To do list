To do list summary:

- Check if author already exists, if so, add a new author/book connection but do not add the author to the table
- Be able to add multiple copies of one book at once
- Sort and print books (by author?)
- be able to search the books using an input
- edit the details of a book
- add a new copy of an existing book
- delete a copy of a book


- When browsing books, clicking on a book shows:
    The number of copies in total
    The number of copies which are currently available.
    Where some books are unavailable, it shows which user borrowed them, and the date that they're due back.
    Members

- The librarian can see a list of library members
    Clicking on a member should show a list of books they have checked out

- The librarian can edit the library members
    Add a new member
    Edit a member
    (e.g. if they change their name)

- Checking in / out
    The librarian can check out a copy of a book to a user.
    Bear in mind:
    We should record when the book is due back (let's say 2 weeks from now)
    The book will have the ID printed on it
    The user won't know their user ID, but they will know their name!
    The librarian can check in books
    The librarian should be told if the book was returned late, so they can give the member a stern telling off!
    The homepage could show a list of books which are currently checked out, who they are checked out by, and the due date for returns.
